# Distributed Application 
### Rishabh Goswami

## Overview

Welcome to the distributed application built with Next.js (React and Node) and PostgreSQL as the database. This project is based on the Vercel Prisma Starter Template provided by the Vercel team. The application allows users to interact with a table, view its contents, and add new data. The backend is implemented using Prisma ORM to connect to a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UrbanErrorist/DA-assignment-week1
   ```

   Set Up Environment Variables:

2. **Clone the Repository:**Locate the example.env file and rename it to .env.
Ensure that all necessary credentials are filled in, including the test PostgreSQL server URL.

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   cd DA-assignment-week1
   yarn run dev
   ```

#Project Structure
##Frontend:

The main page is displayed in the browser and includes components like Table and TableEdit.
Look inside the pages/api/user.ts file to explore the backend logic where Prisma ORM connects to the PostgreSQL database to create a new user.
